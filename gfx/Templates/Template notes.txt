Some notes on the use of the templates:

Drawing can be done in light gray area. When you are finished, just replace the light gray with the transparant blue.

See the GRF specs to see what should go in which file:
http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Action3/Railtypes
http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/NML:Railtypes

Only the entries marked with a */[1] in the spec have to be provided (and currently have templates).
For the lights at the level crossings there is no template yet, so these don't have to be done at this moment.

For bridges only the overlay has to be done. They can almost be the same as the normal overlay graphics, but have
to be slightly modified, because the templates have different sizes.

Please check your work ingame (if possible) for alignments. When needed, offsets can be changed for better alignment.
